# <h1 align="center">ðŸ¦ŽHi! This is a talk with your repo in space!ðŸ¦Ž</h1>

 <h3>A 3D Repository Visualizer, which allows you to query greptile to learn how specific files in your repo tie into the rest of the repo.</h3>

### This serves as a fun way to get to know any repository in a visual and engaging way.</p>

### Sneak Peak:

# ðŸš€ Run Locally ðŸš€

### Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Oia20/aTalkWithYourRepoInSpace.git`

### Enter the project directory: `cd .\aTalkWithYourRepoInSpace\greptileRepoVisualizer\`

### Install Dependencies: `npm install`

### Copy example .env file into your repo: `cp .example.env .env`
Make sure to add in your keys.

### Make your way to `main.tsx` to change the owner, and repo variables to match to repo you want to visualize/learn about.

### Finally , make sure greptile has your repo in their database. One way to do this is through the UI in their docs. [Link to greptile indexing docs](https://docs.greptile.com/api-reference/index)

## Run `npm run dev` and you should be all up and running! ðŸ¦Ž
